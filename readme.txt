Add essential viral sharing functionality to any WordPress site that is based on modern best practices and mobile-first web standards.

With Better Sharing, your users can copy a hyperlink to their clipboards, share it via email, or post it on social media.

== Description ==

Better Sharing includes everything your site needs to create user-friendly sharing functionality that is essential for viral growth in today's online market.

* Allow your users to copy a hyperlink of your choice to their clipboard for quick and easy sharing anywhere that's convenient for them.
* Provide a "Share via Email" form on any page that allows your users to input a comma-separated list of email recipients with whom they would like to share your hyperlink.
* Optionally enable the CloudSponge Contact Picker to allow your users to select contacts directly from their address books rather than typing email addresses manually.
* Display pre-filled social media sharing buttons to make it easy for your users to share your hyperlink on their favorite social platforms.

### Better Sharing for WooCommerce

Also, if you're using any of the following plugins or add-ons for WooCommerce then Better Sharing is a no-brainer.

* [AutomateWoo's Refer A Friend add-on](https://woocommerce.com/products/automatewoo-refer-a-friend/) - Rather than forcing users to manually type up to 5 email addresses into separate text fields, Better Sharing modifies this interface to allow a comma-separated list of email addresses with a preview of the subject and body, as well as an optional [contact picker](https://www.cloudsponge.com/contact-picker/) so that users never have to type anything manually.
* [WooCommerce Wishlists](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-wishlists/) - Override the wishlist's "mailto" link with a beautiful modal dialog for sharing via email with a message preview and [contact picker](https://www.cloudsponge.com/contact-picker/).
* [Coupon Referral Program](https://woocommerce.com/products/coupon-referral-program/) - Let your users easily copy their coupon link to their clipboard or share it via email with a message preview and [contact picker](https://www.cloudsponge.com/contact-picker/).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
